Relational Database with Transaction Support and Strict Serializability

Project Synopsis



A simple relational database with transaction support and stringent serializability is implemented in this project. Data integrity is guaranteed by the database's persistence of data to disc, even in the case of disruptions or failures. The project has tools for managing transactions, committing changes, entering data, and building tables.
